A very interesting project video chat conferencing application.
The purpose of this project is to build a working prototype where more that one users can chat and have video conference with others.

I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS , MomentJS , Socket.IO ( for realtime chat functionality), WEBRTC ,PeerJS , UUID (to generate random urls for meetings) along with HTML and CSS .

I have taken reference from - Web Dev Simplified, Stack overflow(whenever I got stuck it saved me :) ), Traversy Media .

I would like to thank Mr.Osho Bajpai and Mr.Rohan Ankarigari for their constant help and support.
