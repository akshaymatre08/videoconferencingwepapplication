A very interesting project: video chat conferencing application.
The purpose of this project is to build a working prototype where more that one users can chat and have video conference with others.

Here are some of pictures displaying what I have built.

I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS , MomentJS , Socket.IO ( for realtime chat functionality), WEBRTC ,PeerJS , UUID (to generate random urls for meetings) along with HTML and CSS .

I have taken reference from - Web Dev Simplified, Stack overflow(whenever I got stuck it saved me :) ), Traversy Media .

I would like to thank Sudarshan Hon and Akanksha Thokade for their constant help and support.

Do star this repo if you find it useful and interesting.
